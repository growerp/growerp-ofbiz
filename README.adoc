Currently this component is a POC to use Growerp flutter frontend with OFBiz. 
This looks like is possible with the newly introduced plugin for OFBiz: ofbiz-rest-impl which is required to install too for using GrowERP.

to use a local ofbiz installation  you need the standard trunk version and the REST and this plugin.

To use the ofbiz from flutter chrome, you also need to install Nginx or another browser to be able to access OFBiz via http using OFBiz via https is only possible if you have an officially signed certificate

install ofbiz on Ubuntu:
git clone https://github.com/apache/ofbiz-framework.git ofbiz
git clone https://github.com/apache/ofbiz-plugins.git
cp ofbiz-plugins/ofbiz-rest-impl ofbiz/plugins
git clone https://github.com/growerp/growerp-ofbiz.git ofbiz/plugins/growerp
cd ofbiz
./gradlew loadAll
./greadlew ofbiz

When in development, change OFBiz so you do not need a valid ssl certificate:
file: /home/dell/growerpOfbiz/plugins/ofbiz-rest-impl/webapp/ofbiz-rest-jersey/WEB-INF/controller.xml
change: 
    from:     <request-map uri="main"><security https="true"/>
    To:       <request-map uri="main"><security https="false"/>


In bevelopment, for flutter web (android/IOS is ok) you need apache2 in front of ofbiz.
install: 
sudo apt install apache2
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo a2enmod mod_proxy
sudo a2enmod mod_proxy_ajp
replace file: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
with this:
<Proxy *>
        AddDefaultCharset off
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
</Proxy>
ProxyVia On
<LocationMatch "/rest/">
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Authorization"
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"
</LocationMatch>
NameVirtualHost *:80
<VirtualHost *>
    ServerName localhost
    ServerAdmin you@example.com
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    proxyPass /rest ajp://localhost:8009/rest
    proxyPassreverse /rest ajp://localhost:8009/rest
</VirtualHost>

when installed, restart apache2:
systemctl restart apache2

If you know a beter way to avoid the XMLHttpRequest error?
Let me know!
